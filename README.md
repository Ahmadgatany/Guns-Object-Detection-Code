# Guns Object Detection using YOLOv10b

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting guns using the YOLOv10b model. The goal is to accurately identify the presence of guns in images and videos using a custom-trained YOLO model.

## Model Description
- **Model:** YOLOv10b (You Only Look Once version 10b)
- **Framework:** Ultralytics YOLO
- **Training Dataset:** Custom dataset containing images of guns in various scenarios.
- **Objective:** Train a high-accuracy model capable of detecting guns with high precision and recall.

## Project Structure
- `train.py`: Script to train the YOLOv10b model using the custom dataset.
- `detect.py`: Script to run the trained model on test images for inference.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required libraries for the project.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository:
